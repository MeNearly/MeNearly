Hi, Iâ€™m @MeNearly
I use computers since I was 12, and am coding various things from this time.
I worked for Big Blue (aka I've Been Moved), and I am self-employed (or I work on a voluntary basis for friends) since a quite long time).
My main interests are :
- continuing my own-language (an interpreter for something like a "multipurpose object lisp", quite good at almost everything)
- developing IRC bots
- fundamental computer science
- having fun trying lots of POC
- and many other things that aren't too much of a waste of time.

Just ask :)
